[14:18:52] THINK: Starting a new car game project. Following the rules: Sprint 0 is research first. I need to browse real games on itch.io, find visual inspiration, and create INSPIRATION.md BEFORE writing any code. Let me start by researching what car games exist and finding gaps I can fill.

[14:19:06] BROWSER: https://itch.io/games/tag-racing
[14:19:06] RESEARCH: Found interesting games: 1) PolyTrack - low-poly high speed racing, 2) Easy Delivery Co - delivery + driving + barely enough fuel, 3) Tanuki Sunset - relaxing longboard game with retro theme, 4) HELP! NO BRAKE - gimmick where brake pedal is missing, 5) Driftline Peaks - PSX-style touge racing, 6) Nightmare Kart - PS1 horror kart racer. Notable gaps: Most racing games are either pure speed or pure delivery. Very few combine CONSEQUENCES with racing - like delivering fragile items while drifting. The "Easy Delivery Co" touches on fuel economy but doesn't seem to have physics consequences for the cargo.

[14:19:06] RESEARCH: Found: 1) Deep Snow Delivery - WW2 tank delivery with claw arm (unique!), 2) Enviro-Bear 2000 - absurdist bear driving game, 3) No Brakes Valet - valet parking without brakes, 4) Whiplash Taxi Co - break-neck taxi game, 5) The Fish and the Furious - keep car fueled with FISH (quirky fuel mechanic). Interesting pattern: absurdist/quirky driving games do well. The "cargo has consequences" angle is underexplored outside of Deep Snow Delivery. Also noticed: Night Bus - public transit thriller. There's room for a game where WHAT you're carrying affects HOW you must drive.

[14:19:16] RESEARCH: Found gold! 1) Drift Delivery - "delivery game where you can only drift" by JackRoper - this is exactly the concept space I was thinking about but appears simple. 2) Cliffhanger Courier - physics-based delivery in extreme conditions. 3) Damaged in Transit - juggle TWO drones to deliver cargo (dual control). 4) Running Beehind - "Run fast. Deliver WARM" - temperature mechanic for delivery! 5) It's Dinner Time - "Crash hard, Deliver pizza". The gap I see: Nobody combines CARGO FRAGILITY with DRIFT RACING where the drift itself DAMAGES or AFFECTS the cargo in interesting ways. What if the cargo is ALIVE and reacts to your driving?

[14:19:33] THINK: Great research so far! I found a unique concept gap: Most delivery/racing games treat cargo as just a "don't lose it" mechanic. No one has made a game where the CARGO REACTS to your driving and you must balance its needs with speed. What if you're transporting something ALIVE and EMOTIONAL - like animals, angry passengers, or something that PANICS when you drift? This creates a tension between "drive fast to win" and "drive smooth to keep cargo happy". Let me research visual styles that aren't the banned neon/cyberpunk clichés.

[14:19:45] RESEARCH: Found Pear36 palette - 36 colors, warm and friendly feeling. Key colors: purples (#5e315b, #8c3f5d), warm oranges (#f2a65e, #ffb570), bright greens (#cfff70, #8fde5d), teals (#3ca370, #3d6e70), dark blues (#323e4f, #322947). Described as "bright & friendly" - perfect for a game with emotional cargo/passengers. NOT neon/cyberpunk, feels more like a sunset/warm indie game vibe.
[14:19:45] BROWSER: https://lospec.com/palette-list/endesga-32
[14:19:45] RESEARCH: Endesga 32 - famous palette created for NYKRA game. 32 colors with great balance. Key colors: warm reds (#be4a2f, #e43b44), oranges (#f77622, #feae34), yellows (#fee761), greens (#63c74d, #3e8948), blues (#124e89, #0099db, #2ce8f5), purples (#68386c, #b55088). Very versatile, used in many indie games. Good contrast between warm and cool tones.
[14:19:58] VISION: Cargo Panic - Your passengers FREAK OUT when you drift - balance speed with their sanity!

[14:20:52] THINK: Starting Sprint 1: Core Loop. I need to create the basic project structure: main.py for Flask server, index.html, and game.js with Phaser. The core loop should have: 1) A car that can drive with arrow keys, 2) Basic drift physics (car slides when turning at speed), 3) A simple track/road to drive on. No menus, no passengers yet - just "can I drive a car that drifts?"

[14:23:37] THINK: Sprint 1 core loop is built. The server is running. I need to test that the game actually loads and works. The basic structure is: index.html loads Phaser and main.js, which imports GameScene and Car. Let me now build Sprint 2: adding menu scene, game over scene, and the actual delivery/passenger system. This will make it a complete game loop.

[14:25:36] THINK: Sprint 2 complete! Now Sprint 3: Polish. I should add: 1) Screen shake when panicking, 2) Better visual feedback on drift, 3) Improve the passenger visual reaction system, 4) Add some simple buildings/environment decoration, 5) Better UI styling. Let me also add a requirements.txt for easier setup.

[14:28:18] THINK: Game complete! Cargo Panic is a fully playable taxi game with: 1) Menu scene with instructions, 2) Core gameplay with drift physics and panic system, 3) Pickup/dropoff delivery loop, 4) Visual feedback (smoke, tire marks, passenger reactions), 5) Game over screen with stats. The unique hook is that passengers REACT to your driving - drifting scares them! Players must balance speed vs. keeping passengers calm.
