# Visual Inspiration Document

## Reference Games (from itch.io research)

### 1. Easy Delivery Co
- **URL:** https://itch.io/games/tag-delivery (by Sweaters)
- **What I noticed:** Delivery + driving combo with fuel economy as main constraint. Simple art style, focus on the "barely enough to survive" economy tension.
- **What I'll borrow:** The delivery mission structure - pick up, drive, deliver
- **What I'll do differently:** Instead of fuel as the constraint, PASSENGER PANIC is the constraint. The cargo isn't passive - it reacts emotionally to your driving.

### 2. Enviro-Bear 2000
- **URL:** https://itch.io/games/tag-driving (by Captain Games)
- **What I noticed:** Absurdist premise "A Bear is Driving!" - the humor comes from the ridiculous situation, not from jokes. Simple graphics but the CONCEPT carries it.
- **What I'll borrow:** The absurdist "everything is going wrong" feeling
- **What I'll do differently:** More structured gameplay with clear win/lose conditions, not pure chaos

### 3. No Brakes Valet
- **URL:** https://itch.io/games/tag-driving (by Captain Games)
- **What I noticed:** Single gimmick (no brakes) creates all the comedy. Valet parking without brakes = chaos. Constraint-based humor.
- **What I'll borrow:** The "one constraint changes everything" design philosophy
- **What I'll do differently:** My constraint is passenger panic, not missing controls

### 4. Drift Delivery
- **URL:** https://itch.io/games/tag-delivery (by JackRoper)
- **What I noticed:** "Delivery game where you can only drift" - similar concept space but appears to be a simple physics challenge. Drifting IS the mechanic.
- **What I'll borrow:** Nothing visual - but confirmed this concept space exists
- **What I'll do differently:** Drifting has CONSEQUENCES (panic), not just a control scheme. Creates tension between "drift to go fast" vs "drift scares passengers"

### 5. Running Beehind
- **URL:** https://itch.io/games/tag-delivery (by 49B)
- **What I noticed:** "Run fast. Deliver WARM." - cargo has a TEMPERATURE that matters! The cargo isn't just "don't drop it" - it has a state that changes.
- **What I'll borrow:** The idea that cargo has a changing state (temperature → panic)
- **What I'll do differently:** Visual feedback on passenger emotions, not just a meter

## Color Palette Research

### Source: Lospec Pear36
- **URL:** https://lospec.com/palette-list/pear36
- **Why I chose it:** Described as "bright & friendly" by the community. Warm sunset tones that feel playful, not aggressive. Perfect for a comedy game about panicking passengers.
- **NOT cyberpunk/neon:** This palette has warm oranges, friendly purples, and natural greens - feels like a cartoon, not a sci-fi racer.

## My Color Palette (EXACT hex codes)

| Role | Color | Hex | Source |
|------|-------|-----|--------|
| Background (road) | Dark slate | #323e4f | Pear36 |
| Background (grass) | Forest green | #3ca370 | Pear36 |
| Car body | Warm orange | #f2a65e | Pear36 |
| Car accent | Deep purple | #5e315b | Pear36 |
| Passenger calm | Soft teal | #3d6e70 | Pear36 |
| Passenger panic | Hot coral | #e36956 | Pear36 |
| UI text | Cream white | #fffeb | Pear36 |
| UI accent | Bright yellow | #ffe478 | Pear36 |
| Danger/warning | Pink-red | #ff6b97 | Pear36 |

## Visual Style Summary

**In one sentence:** Warm sunset cartoon aesthetic with chunky, friendly shapes - like a children's book illustration meets top-down arcade racer.

**NOT:** Neon cyberpunk, synthwave, Tron-style, or any cyan/magenta glow aesthetic.

## Unique Visual Hook

**What will make players say "I've never seen a game that looks like this"?**

The passengers in the back visually REACT to your driving:
- Calm: Sitting peacefully, maybe reading a book
- Worried: Gripping the seat, eyes wide  
- Panicking: Arms flailing, screaming face, items flying around
- Bailing: Literally jumping out of the car

The car interior becomes a comedy show. You're watching TWO things: the road AND the chaos in your rearview mirror.

## Anti-Cliche Check

Before finalizing, answer honestly:
- Does this concept sound like "default AI answer"? **NO** - AI defaults to "neon racing" or "time manipulation"
- Would a human say "that's so AI-generated"? **NO** - the passenger panic mechanic is specific and quirky
- Is this in the BANNED CONCEPTS list? **NO** - no neon, no synthwave, no gravity flips, no time rewind
- Did I actually USE something specific from my research? **YES** - Running Beehind's "cargo has state" and No Brakes Valet's "one constraint" philosophy

## Game Concept Summary

**CARGO PANIC**

You're a taxi driver with extremely nervous passengers. Get them to their destination before the timer runs out, but if they panic too much, they'll bail out and you fail.

**Core tension:** Drifting/speeding is FAST but increases PANIC. Smooth driving is SLOW but keeps them calm.

**Win condition:** Deliver X passengers before time runs out
**Lose condition:** Passenger panic meter hits 100% (they bail)

**Progression:** Later passengers are MORE nervous, shorter fuses, tighter time limits
