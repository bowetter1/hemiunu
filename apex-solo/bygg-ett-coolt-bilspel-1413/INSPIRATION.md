# Visual Inspiration Document

## Reference Games (minimum 3)

- **Colors they use:** Bright solid colors against neutral backgrounds
- **What I'll borrow:** Clean visual separation between car and track
- **What I'll do differently:** Night setting instead of daytime, focus on trails instead of speed

- **URL:** https://itch.io/games/tag-racing
- **What I noticed:** VEKTOR has futuristic anti-gravity with neon trails, shows trails CAN be a visual feature

**In one sentence:** Warm sunset-orange neon trails against deep midnight blue, creating a cozy night-drive atmosphere with SLSO8's signature warmth.

## Unique Visual Hook

What will make players say "I've never seen a game that looks like this"?

The trails your car leaves ARE the game - not just visual decoration. Every drift creates a glowing orange-peach painting on the dark blue canvas of the road. By the end of a run, the screen is covered in your personal neon artwork. It's a racing game that creates generative art from your driving.
