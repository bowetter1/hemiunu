      "type": "FACT",
      "topic": "Economy",
      "content": "The company reported $5B in revenue",
      "source": "Company quarterly report",

Rules:
1. STRICT SEPARATION: Facts, opinions, and quotes must NEVER mix in the same row.
   - FACT: Verifiable data, statistics, laws, dates, official records
   - OPINION: Subjective interpretations, predictions, value judgments
   - QUOTE: Direct statements from named individuals

2. TOPIC CLASSIFICATION (REQUIRED): Every row MUST have a "topic" field. Choose from:
   - "Economy" (finance, business, markets, trade)
   - "Politics" (government, law, elections)
   - "Technology" (science, innovation, digital)
   - "Security" (military, defense, safety)
   - "Environment" (climate, nature, energy)
   - "Health" (medicine, healthcare)
   - "Social" (culture, society, sports)
   - "Other" (only if none of the above fit)

3. Each grid row must be atomic and independently understandable.
4. Provide a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0.
5. Include the source (who said it, which organization verified it).
6. Set status=UNVERIFIED if source is unclear or cannot be verified.
7. Extract at least 3-6 statements per article, covering multiple topics if possible.
